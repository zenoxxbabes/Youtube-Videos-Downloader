# 🔻YouTube Video Downloader

This is a **raw frontend** for a YouTube video downloader. Due to YouTube's restrictions and policies, this project does **not** support actual downloading of YouTube videos.

## 🚫 Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only** and does **not** include any backend or API capable of bypassing YouTube’s restrictions or downloading YouTube videos.

## 🛠 Features
- Clean and simple UI
- Input field for video URL
- Placeholder button for downloading
- Can be extended for other video sources (if supported)

## ❗ Limitations
- **Does not download YouTube videos**
- No backend/API integrated
- YouTube blocking prevents download functionality

## ✅ How to Use
1. Paste a video link (currently for demo only)
2. Click the download button (no real download happens)
3. UI can be used for integrating any valid download backend or external API

## 📁 Files
- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `style.css` – Basic styling
- `script.js` – Button logic (demo only)

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Add support for other video sources
- Connect to a valid server-side API for video processing
- Convert to a multi-platform downloader UI
